## Example App

Simple Next.js chat application demonstrating integration with the dat1 gpt-oss-120b model. See [dat1-example-app/README.md](./dat1-example-app/README.md) for details.

## Deploying custom models

See `dat1-deploy-custom-models`:
- `dat1-deploy-custom-models/bge-reranker`: downloads a reranker from Huggingface and uploads it to dat1, then provides an endpoint to use it (serverless)
- `dat1-deploy-custom-models/llama-chat`: first download LLaMA 3.2 3B locally, then upload it to dat1, then get an endpoint to use it
